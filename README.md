# BETS
Causal Network Inference and Analysis from Time Series

BETS is a software package that infers causal networks from time series data.

It was developed by Jonathan Lu, Bianca Dumitrascu, and Professor Barbara Engelhardt in the [Engelhardt Group](beehive.cs.princeton.edu) at the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University
over 2016-2019.


# Requirements

BETS requires installation of the following libraries:

* numpy
* scipy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* sklearn


It has been tested in Python 2.7 on MacOSX v.10.11.6.


# Method 

BETS is short for "Bootstrap Elastic net regression from Time Series", a statistical framework based on Granger causality for the recovery of a directed gene network from transcriptional time series data. applies regularized vector autoregression along with a permutation-based 
null and False Discovery control to infer causal networks. It was designed
for a high-dimensional gene-expression time series data.
